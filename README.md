3-channel conversion method
--------------------------------
* more specific/fine-tune control
* can do it all in flash, all editing saved
* simple program -> complicated editing
- create: red:x, green:y, blue:z images
- import 3 images into program
- perform normals calculations
- output single combined image

automated
--------------------------------
* settings can be saved for specific conversion
* automated, might not need very specific controls
* no editing -> complicated program
- import single texture image
- import settings/none
- determine directions, etc of 
- like repeating-pattern ability
- live parameter editing
- live output of result
- need to texture scene in webGL
